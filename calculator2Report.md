 - Positive answer of the quadraticFormula method: failed. 
org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError:  - This should return the square root of b^2 - 4ac. Can use Math.sqrt to square root the answer. ==> expected: <8.54400374531753> but was: <NaN>
 - quadraticFormula method: Overall, the final function doesn't give the right answer 
org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError:  - This should return the square root of b^2 - 4ac. Can use Math.sqrt to square root the answer. ==> expected: <8.54400374531753> but was: <NaN>
 - Error found in the squareRootAnswer Method; Square root is the opposite of squaring a number. There is a function in the maths library to square root: Math.sqrt(X).
org.opentest4j.MultipleFailuresError: Multiple Failures (3 failures)
	org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: sqrt 16 = 4 ==> expected: <4.0> but was: <4.898979485566356>
	org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: sqrt 64 = 8 ==> expected: <8.0> but was: <7.874007874011811>
	org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: sqrt 100 = 10 ==> expected: <10.0> but was: <8.94427190999916>
 - 4AC method WORKS! 
 - Square of B method WORKS! 
 - Negative answer of the quadraticFormula method: failed. 
org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError:  - This should return the square root of b^2 - 4ac. Can use Math.sqrt to square root the answer. ==> expected: <8.54400374531753> but was: <NaN>
